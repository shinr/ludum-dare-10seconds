a videogame for ludum dare 27 compo

done with python using pyglet
windows binary, source included, requires python 2.7 and pyglet

aseprite for graphics, renoise for music, audacity for sounds

As usual, ludum dare never goes just as planned, so this one ended up a bit lighter on stuff than
I originally envisioned. Some lovecraftian pieces of code were buried. It's better we don't speak about it.
